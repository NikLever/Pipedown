1. The game could use some more juice, to make things more rewarding, here's a nice video about it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy0aCDmgnxg&amp;ab_channel=grapefrukt.
2. Something that would be super easy to do is giving players the option to change the skybox, just to give a bit of customization to the game;
3. The UI elements look a bit crude, especially the congratulatory text at the end of a level;
4. There could be a small Level Selection UI that allows players to repeat older levels.
5. Zooming in on the pipes there's a reflection of a house, I'm not sure if its intentional, but I'd remove it.
6. It would be great if pipe pieces could be moved from one side of the pipe to the other, without having to move it around the other pipes.
7. I only reached until level 8, but I didn't see any different obstacles, it would be great to see more stuff like the Cut the Rope Series does so brilliantly
